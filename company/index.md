## Objective

#### - Autonomous Learning Cluster

Supported by a group of specialists in scalable computing, machine learning and open-source software. We seek to integrate autonomous data acquisition/valorisation into scalable machine learning pipeline end-to-end, proactively using the Internet, telemetrics and sensor network to train and improve itself.

We believe that state-of-the-art AI algorithms and architectures perform best on large amount of real data, unconstrained of down-sampling, manual annotation and cost control. As a result, our solutions leverage the best of web crawling, APIs, unstructured data management and ensemble/proactive learning algorithm, and scale all components adaptively to perform under varying resources and minimal supervision.

#### Big Data Engineer

Must have:

- Understanding of algorithm, complexity, scalability, parallel computing and optimization

- Proficient in the art of persuasion – you'll use that a lot to persuade others to adopt your idea!

- Prefer proof-of-concept, coordination and convergence of vision over brute force and unproven hypotheses

- object oriented programming

- Scala/Java

- git

- maven/sbt/gradle

- prefer Linux for daily use over Windows: RHEL/ubuntu preferred, MacOS also works if you know it well

Good to have:

- active open-source project committer

- Any machine learning/artificial intelligence R&D experience will be helpful

- Apache Spark

- Apache Hadoop and its ecosystem

- functional programming

- understanding of HTTP protocal, RESTful API and JSON format

- operational experience in Amazon EC2/S3

- prefer to work on personal laptop over dedicated workstation

- experience in JavaScript, any of its frameworks or Python a plus.
