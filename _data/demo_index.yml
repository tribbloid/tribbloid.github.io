#    Such record-breaking speed is achieved by a combination of query optimizer, distributed web caching and extemely lightweight implementation.

#        <li>Also with the shortest script: can be as short as 5 lines</li>
#        <li>Certified to run on any Spark cluster</li>

#    With simplicity prioritized, the pipeline API hides the engineering details of distributed crawling & data extraction so you
#    can concentrate on the beauty of data science.
