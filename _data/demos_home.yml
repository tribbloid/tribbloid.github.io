#      <ul>
#        <li>Also with the shortest script: can be as short as 5 lines</li>
#        <li>Certified to run on any Spark cluster</li>
#      </ul>
    Write a query in 5 lines, deploy to any Spark cluster, scale to thousands of web clients and deliver your data product from the deep web in seconds.
    Such record-breaking speed is achieved by a combination of query optimizer, distributed web caching and extemely lightweight implementation.

    <h3>It's a deploy-and-forget-thing.</h3>
    Why reinventing the wheel? Adding a COTS web service as a stage to your data pipeline generally takes 5 minutes, or 30 seconds if someone has already done so.
    After that, the stage can become permanently effective once shared online: it will be tested daily by our servers
    and updated in a few hours whenever it became obsolete.

    With simplicity prioritized, the pipeline API hides the engineering details of data extraction so you
    can concentrate on the beauty of data science.
