You are living the dream of the second machine age: you and the sharpest data scientists surrounding you are deploying the state-of-the-art, most adaptive AI algorithms to a massive and elastic computing architecture. In this case, why blindfold it with your internal data? Your machine has the capacity for real knowledge and experience, more than the down-sampled, transformed and manually annotated "internal" ones that once cost a fortune but quickly became obsolete.

Here at tribbloids.com, we aims to blur the boundary between machine intelligence and data acquisition, our creations are proactive learning machines - information singularities that proactively seek whatever training materials available - regardless of whether they are from in-house datasets, internet, telemetrics or sensors, and use these knowledge to improve themselves without human intervention. We are supported by...

Autonomous Data Acquisition Ã— Machine Learning = Proactive Learning Machine



tribbloids is a Toronto-based company specialized in massively scalable data acquisition and proactive machine learning.



Our motivation is simple: to accelerate the learning process of artificial intelligence with real knowledge and experience. Unimpressed by the

The way we see it:

Active data acquisition is infused into the machine learning pipeline.
